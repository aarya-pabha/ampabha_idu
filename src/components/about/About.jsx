          <p>
          Hey! I'm Aarya, a Data Science professional with a passion for solving complex problems, 
          I bring a blend of advanced technical expertise and strong interpersonal skills. 
          With an ongoing Master's in Data Science from Indiana University and a Bachelor's in Computer Science, 
          I have honed my abilities in machine learning, deep learning, data analytics, and automation, 
          notably through an impactful internship and projects. From developing a wildfire 
          detection model with 97.8% accuracy to enhancing image generation techniques, 
          my technical work is driven by a commitment to innovation. Beyond the code, 
          my leadership roles and volunteer experience reflect my dedication to collaboration, 
          empathy, and empowering others, creating a well-rounded approach to both technical and humanÂ challenges.
          </p>
